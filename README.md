# FoxyMaxi

This Project was my thesis work for Business Informatics Bsc. at the University of Szeged in 2022.
It is a platformer game made with Unity. The main build is for Windows, which can be accessed under the /WinInstaller folder.
The orginal thesis is under the /Docs folder.

The game played online here: https://papp-marton.github.io/FoxyMaxi/
  Controls:
    Move - WASD
    Jump - Space
    Shoot - Ctrl
    
The online version of the game is limited in functionality compared to the Windows version due to
technological differences in Unity handling persistent data. Because of this. the oline version
does not support loading/saving custom map files.
